## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS variables
- Mobile-first workflow
- Webpage Responsiveness

### What I learned

I learnt and implemented the responsiveness of a webpage.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@media(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1440px){
  /* properties are here */
}
```
### Continued development

I want to improve more on responiveness of webpages and applying Mobile-first workflow. Also will keep learning on semantic HTML as well to be more used to it.

### Useful resources

- [Responsive web design](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me to implement responsive web design using ```@media``` media query.
